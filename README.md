# nea-it-1

## Description

This is iteration 1 of my NEA project designed to help students learn Japanese. This iteration is a simple command line interface that allows the user to test their knowledge of Japanese vocabulary.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.22. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
